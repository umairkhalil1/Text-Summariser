A gunman has opened fire in a village in Switzerland, killing three people and wounding two others, Swiss media reports say.

The attack late on Wednesday happened in the village of Daillon, north-west of the city of Sion in southern Switzerland.

Several people were reportedly lying in the street after shots were fired.

Swiss broadcaster RTS said police later arrested a suspect who was shot and wounded after he had threatened them.

Police did not name the arrested man, whom witnesses identified to local media as a 30-year-old Daillon resident.

The gunman was armed with an assault rifle and was thought to have been drinking heavily.
